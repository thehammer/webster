## Bottom line

Webster now leads on almost every functional dimension. The only things Claude-in-Chrome still has exclusively are **shortcuts/workflows** and the **plan approval flow** — both UX conveniences rather than automation capabilities.

Webster's durable advantages:
- **Multi-browser** — Chrome + Firefox + Safari simultaneously, with routing. Claude-in-Chrome is Chrome-only.
- **Automation primitives** — `wait_for`, `wait_for_network_idle`, localStorage, cookies. Better for building reliable agents.
- **Selector fallback** — automatically retries via a11y tree when CSS selectors fail.
- **Open source / embeddable** — ship Webster with a product. No dependency on Anthropic's extension being available.
- **Transport control** — configurable port, extensible protocol.

The main remaining risk: if Anthropic ships Firefox/Safari extensions through marketplaces, the installation friction gap disappears. The functional and architectural advantages remain.
